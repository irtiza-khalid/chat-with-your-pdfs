# AI Agents for PDF Interaction  

## Introduction  
This repository contains the implementation of an **AI Agent for PDF Interaction**. The system allows users to chat with complex PDF documents using a multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. By leveraging advanced technologies like **vLLM**, **few-shot learning**, and **dynamic prompting**, the system ensures accurate and context-aware results. The project is powered by **Gemini** or **OpenAI APIs**, offering seamless interaction with PDFs for efficient content extraction, understanding, and querying.

## Key Features  
- **Multimodal RAG System**: Combines text, tables, and visual elements for comprehensive document understanding.  
- **Few-Shot Learning**: Incorporates examples dynamically to enhance the accuracy of responses.  
- **Dynamic Prompting**: Adapts prompts in real-time for contextually relevant answers.  
- **Powerful Backend**: Built using vLLM for efficient inference and scaling.  
- **Flexible API Integration**: Supports both Gemini and OpenAI for model inference.  
- **User-Friendly**: Chat-based interface for easy interaction with complex PDFs.
